VERSIONING
----------
0. February 18, 2011

    5. February 18, 2011

        0. February 18, 2011

            * Adds LIST command.
            * Changes filehandle to while (my $line = <$MOTD>) in user::handle_motd

        1. February 19, 2011

            * Adds channel mode z - ops may view what a user is saying if he or she is incapable of PRIVMSGing or NOTICEing the channel.
            * Fixes a bug with sprintf in user::sendserv in WHO and NAMES where the % prefix caused issues.

        2. February 19, 2011

            * Rehash notice is sent before actually rehashing.
            * Added ISON command.
            * Redid cloaking - you don't even want to know the issue before. (Now requires Digest::SHA (core))

        3. February 19, 2011

            * Supposedly fixes bug in perl module loader with an import. (this was a fatal bug.)

        4. February 19, 2011

            * Actually fixes bug in perl module loader with an import. (this was a fatal bug.)
            * Adds --version to juno.pl

        5. February 19, 2011

            * Does cloaking by each piece of the host rather than the entire entire host hashed.
            * Adds checking for both actual host and visible host with bans.
            * After forgetting, add z to CHANMODES.
            * Display time properly in 003 numeric.

        6. February 22, 2011

            * Fixes bug in NICK command that does not allow you to change your nick from say Someone to SomeOne.
            * Fixes bug in NICK command where the nick change is not relayed to the user who sent it if they are in no channels.
            * Fixes "Odd number of elements in hash assignment at user.pm line 344." in user::handle_nick.

        7. February 22, 2011

            * Major cleanups in user.pm (in almost every handler).
            * Replaces user::sendnum with user::numeric and the %user::numerics hash. (this has existed, but is just now being cleaned up.)
              Note: sendnum is still a valid function; it is used in the numerics displayed upon connecting in VERSION.

        8. February 22, 2011

            * Replaces a few various variables with %main::GV.
              This hash is used to store information more easily with less of a mess.
            * The MOTD is now stored in %main::GV rather than opening and reading the file with every /MOTD.
            * Cleaned up user::new by removing all of the now broken host resolving stuff.
            * Fixed channel.pm to where nonops can see the ban and mute lists but still not entirely fixed because I and e should be op-only.

        9. February 22, 2011

            * Cleaned up numerics in channel.pm where it matters, but didn't clean up the stuff that will be eventually redone.
            * Also cleaned up channel::allsend with sprintf.
            * Other various cleanup in channel.pm.
            * Fixed numeric 432 => 433 in handle.pm (Nick is already in use).
              - I forgot a bracket and pushed, but then I fixed it immediately after.
            * After committing a fail, I fixed channel::allsend. Syntax is now channel->allsend(string, user to be ignored or 0, sprintf values).

    6. February 24, 2011

        0. February 24, 2011

            * Cleaned up channel.pm by completely rewriting the messy handlestatus and sendmasklist subs.
            * Also cleaned up the channel mode handler a bit.
              This should fix the bug with viewing bans, exceptions, invite exceptions, and mutes.
              Because the majority of channel.pm has been rewritten and lightly tested, it is likely that bugs will be discovered from here on.

        1. February 25, 2011

            * S is now for away in WHO query. (how that happened: the world may never know)
            * Added user::acceptcheck. This checks if the server is accepting new connections. (defined by limit:clients)
            * Added user::ip_accept. This prevents a user from connecting if their per-ip limit is reached. (defined by limit:perip)
              This will also be used when Z-Line is added, forcing the user to disconnect before they finish the connection process.
              These fixes should fix the crash that occurs when the server accepts more connections than it can handle.
            * Changed ping:msg to use sprintf for the number of seconds.
            * Changed SIGINT handler to quit each user properly before killing the IRCd.
            * Moved juno.pl to juno, making it executable and updating documentation and ./juno --help.

        2. February 25, 2011

            * Misc. cleanup.
            * Cleaned up WHOIS numerics.
            * Fixed bug in part - forgot a parameter for sprintf.
            * Fixed 324 numeric (forgot +).
            * Fixed "You're not a channel" in channel status setting.
            * Fixed bug where anyone can set modes e, b, Z, and I.

        3. February 26, 2011

            * Adds Z-Line.
              This adds the zline block to the configuration.
            * Fixes rehash to clear all configuration options (excluding listen) before resetting them.

        4. February 26, 2011

            * Fixed bug where attempting to set qaohv without parameters replies with a "You're not a channel operator" numeric.
            * Added channel mode l (channel user limit).
            * Fixed misc. bugs in channel mode handler.
            * Prepared mode handler for future modes.

        5. February 28, 2011

            * A user may not change his nick if he is banned or muted in a channel.
              Why was such a small change an increase in version..?

        6. February 28, 2011

            * Discovered bug and fixed the entire channel::dojoin subroutine.
            * This bug caused various issues upon joining, such as replying with "you are banned" even if you aren't, allowing you in a +i channel without an invite, etc.
            * After forgetting, add i to CHANMODES.

        7. March 1, 2011

            * Fixed bug in channel.pm where topic changes are sent improperly.
            * Fixed a similar bug in viewing topics (too many sprintf parameters).
            * Fixed bug where MOTD is not reset and is instead appended upon rehash.

        8. March 1, 2011

            * Prepared for displayed host changing by redoing the way cloaking sets cloaks.

        9. March 1, 2011

            * Added auto-access mode A. This gives accesss to a user that matches the mask provided. (see README.)

    7. March 1, 2011

        0. March 1, 2011

            * Channel mode A now checks both displayed and actual hosts (formerly only displayed).
            * Fixed bug in part - user::fullcloak != user::nick.

        1. March 1, 2011

            * Fixed bug where everyone gets every status in auto-access. (wow, fail)
            * Added vhost to oper block - set virtual host upon opering.
            * Fixed bug in auto-access so that you only receive each mode that applies to you once.
            * Made host matching insensitive to case for bans, mutes, etc.

        2. March 3, 2011

            * Masks in channel modes are now fully insensitive.
            * Setting mode -b SOMEONE!*@* before would not remove a ban on someone!*@*, but now it will.
            * Did a bit of cleanup in channel.pm.

        3. March 4, 2011

            * Put package above use in all packages.
            * Began the base of the module API.
            * Added Hello World module as an example module.
            * Automatically loaded modules are separated by commas in main:modules.
            * If no modules are to be loaded, set as 0 to disable.
            * Because the module API requires Class::Unload, added a configuration option to enable or disable the API completely.

        4. March 5, 2011

            * Added API::alias_register: this is used to add serverside aliases to juno more easily.
              Unfortunately, there are not yet variables for arguments sent, but this is planned.
              See hello world module for an example.
            * All API functions must now return true value in order to be successful - see helloworld module.
            * Added MODLOAD command and modload oper flag.
            - "Prepend" should have been "append" in the commit, but "prepend" each module with .pm (this failed)

        5. March 5, 2011

            * Fixed syntax error with .pm in API.
            * Forgot to do the same in MODLOAD; fixed.
            * Fixed main file to where API is not required (defined by enabled:API).
            * Added API timers and a timertest module for an example.

        6. March 6, 2011

            * A LOT of misc. cleanup, perhaps the largest cleanup in juno's history. (this is bound to result in future bugs.)
            * Added --stop argument and --restart argument.
            * Added TERM signal handler.

        7. March 6, 2011

            * Fixed a major bug where the outbuffer does not clear properly.
            * Fixed bug in numeric where the user object was being sent in numerics. (Fail)
            * Added a sleep to --restart argument to ensure that the process was killed before attempting to listen.

        8. March 7, 2011

            * API modules must be named API::module::mode_name_here as of now.
              Formerly, API::module_name_here was acceptable, but due to future API extensions this is no longer valid.
            * Fixed bug in user::ison that pretty much broke the entire channel system.
            * Fixed bug in NAMES and WHO commands with sprintf - no longer prefixes nick twice with % if the user is halfopped.

        9. March 13, 2011

            * Created a bash script to handle stop, start, rehash, etc.
              This script allows juno to be run from any directory - juno was also edited to work properly with this script.
              Juno may no longer be run without the use of this script unless all proper parameters are given.
            * Now deleted PID file when exiting.

    8. March 13, 2011

        0. March 5, 2011

            * All API plans have been canceled.
            * Moved version stuff to etc/version.
            * Added restart option to ./juno.

        1. March 19, 2011

            * Changed all spacing from two to four spaces because it looks nicer.
            * Removed a few more remains of the module API.
            * Removed indev from the git ignore file.

        2. March 20, 2011

            * Moved miscellaneous functions to utils package rather than main.
            * Discovered bug: nick changes are sent twice if to the user changing his nick if he is in a channel with himself. (or at least I think that's the problem.)
            * "Read error" -> "Connection closed"

        3. March 20, 2011

            * Misc. Cleanup, mostly in the invite handler. Also changed split()s.
            * Majorly cleaned up bin/juno - just a cleanliness check.
            * Channel mode z no longer allows users to override channel mode n; users must be in the channel to be affected by this mode.
            * Added SACONNECT command like that in InspIRCd.
            * Removed a few more things about the former module API from docs.

        4. March 24, 2011

            * Made indev prettier.
            * Rewrote start/stop/rehash script.
              It now has help and version actions.
              Attempting to run it without arguments prints the usage help.

        5. March 24, 2011

            * Fail, $D should be $DIR in bin/juno... who knows how that happened? Fixed.
            * Version script failed, but I fixed it.
