<insert ASCII art here>

as you know, I attempted to fork pIRCd while learning perl. that failed very badly. now I'm starting over from scratch because I have nothing better to do.

setting up: edit ircd.conf and read the comments.
	perl juno.pl

support: irc.flsnet.co.cc #chat, probably. maybe not.

requirements:
IO::Select (core)
IO::Socket::INET (core)
Socket (core)
POSIX (core)
IO::Socket::SSL if you want SSL support
IO::Socket::INET6 if you want IPv6 support

Plans - things I plan to do

I'm not going to put anything here until I run out of useful things to do.

TODO - things I NEED to do
----
